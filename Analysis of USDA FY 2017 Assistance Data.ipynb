    "This report aims to gain some insights on how U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) assistance - in the form of grants, loans, and other financial assistance - were broken down and distributed in fiscal year (FY) 2017 (October 2016 - September 2017) by the USDA agencies and staff offices that are responsible for these funds. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data was obtained from https://www.usaspending.gov, which is the publicly accessible, searchable website mandated by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 to give the American public access to information on how their tax dollars are spent. The data contains information about the name of the entity receiving the award, the amount of the award, the recipient’s location, and the place of performance location, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Term:\n",
    "***Federal assistance*** is any federal activity provided by the federal government that involves the transfer of money, property, services, or anything of value to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation that directly assists domestic entities or individuals in the areas of education, health, and public welfare, among others. The federal government provided over 2.13 trillion dollars in assistance in FY 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1)** Which USDA agency provided the most assistance? Are there outliers? What types of assistance and recipient were most funded? \n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** What was the funding distribution for programs that provided the most assistance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**3)** What was the average and breakdown of the assistance for the non-outlier agencies?\n",
    "\n",
    "**4)** Are there notable correlations among variables?"

    "## Question 2  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What was the payment distribution for the programs that provided the most funding?\n",
    "Three-fourths of FSA’s transactions were from two programs - 10.112 and 10.113 - which involve price loss and agricultural risk coverage. Price loss coverage provides payments to farmers when prices for certain commodities, such as corn and wheat, fall below a fixed reference price set in statute. Agricultural risk coverage payments, on the other hand, are provided when crop revenue falls below 86 percent of historical revenue. The high volume of payments (mostly to landowners and producers in rural communities) is somewhat expected given the economic and environmental conditions in the past year brought about by natural disasters such drought, wildfires, and deadly hurricanes, among others, which adversely impacted crop production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over half of FNS's 36 billion dollars in assistance, on the other hand, came from a single source – The National School Lunch Program (10.555). This program provides low-cost or free lunches to more than 30 million children in approximately 95 percent of schools across the country on an average day. A distant second but still notable at over 6.7 billion dollars involves the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (10.557), which provides healthcare and nutrition assistance to low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and children under the age of five. Both 10.555 and 10.557 are awarded as formula grants to states, which match these assistance and recipient types’ share of funding as shown in their corresponding plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boxplot shows FSA's payments are clustered within a tight range compared to FNS's. As an example, FSA's 10.112 and 10.113 are within 20 million dollars, while FNS's 10.555 and 10.557 have a much wider range, with 10.555 having five payments over the 600 million dollar mark, two of which were over 700 million. This distribution is in line with the type of recipients these agencies and programs serve."

    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "## What was the average and breakdown of the assistance for the non-outlier agencies?\n",
    "Taking out the outliers - the top four and bottom four agencies that exhibited \"extreme\" levels of funding (refer to dataframe in 1.1) - what does the average USDA assistance look like? The average total assistance for the non-outlier agencies was about 39 million dollars (indicated by dashed vertical line). The plots show a mixture of assistance and recipient types that correspond to the agencies’ purpose and mission. For example, the Risk Management Agency provided insurance to profit organizations, which is in line with its mission to promote and regulate sound risk management solutions to agricultural producers through its partnerships with private insurance companies that are responsible for various insurance policies. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the non-outlier agencies' error bars, except for the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), exhibit a wide spread, which indicate the assistance provided by each agency varied greatly from its average assistance - as opposed to NIFA's, which has a tight cluster around its mean. Consequently, these agencies’ average assistance do not necessarily represent their assistance data accurately. For example, in the case of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, it would be inaccurate to state its assistance, on average, was 300,000 dollars because of the wide variation in assistance, from a low of about 20,000 dollars to a high of close to 600,000 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the only comparison that can be made regarding statistical significance among the agencies include the Agricultural Research Service ARS vs. the Rural Utilities Service RUS. Since they have almost the same number of transactions (a little over 100), and their error bars do not overlap, it can be concluded that the difference between their average assistance is statistically significant with a P value less than 0.05, i.e., the difference is caused by something other than random chance."

    "## Are there notable correlations among the variables?\n",
    "Multiple correlations can be shown for the different variables, but for purposes of illustration, only the ones showing a positive correlation with the federal funding amount are shown. This implies that these variables move in tandem with the federal funding amount: as federal funding increases, a corresponding increase in these variables can be observed, and vice versa. The closer the correlation coefficient is to 1.0, the stronger the relationship between the variable and the federal funding amount. The Food and Nutrition Service, 10.555, 10.557, 10.566, formula grants, and state governments have coefficients closest to 1.0; as such, these variables should expect more pronounced upticks in activity when federal funding goes up."

    "This report provided a high-level overview of USDA’s FY 2017 assistance. Some points to consider for further research include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1)** Trends across multiple FYs that would provide information on agencies’ activities across different timeframes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** Correlation and clustering techniques that would provide clearer insights on how variables could actually be related to each other. Since the data is mostly categorical, the chi-square test would perhaps be more appropriate as opposed to the Pearson correlation coefficients that were derived above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**3)** Conduct anomaly detection to determine if any of the data is out of place; for example, did agencies provide funding to certain recipients more than they should have?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**4)** An area map to show assistance distribution across the country.  "
